(*
Decisions:
  * keep state and not a list of transactions. The only difference is knowledge about past transactions.

  * Ideal model: Transactions as (pre-state, post-state) pairs? Perhaps we need separation logic for locality.
                 Kripke structure, and transaction is (p, q) for some predicates.

(*
Not in the model:
* Contracts
* Structure of a persistent state
* Money (a property of a contract?)
* knowledge and belief of agents
* Miners
* Gas
* Cryptography
* Probabilities
